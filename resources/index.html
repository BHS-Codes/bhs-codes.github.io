                <dd>Uses (actually) interactive video lessons to teach stuff!
                    Very good for beginners and has a couple of free courses.
                    Github Education (see below) users can get free access to pro courses for one month.

                <dd>A reading-heavy but effective course for web development. Entirely free and online!</dd>

                <dt>freecodecamp.org</dt>
                <dd>
                    Interactive lessons that let you learn by doing.
                    Not very in-depth but still a solid resource.

                    Really good resource with a great curriculum! I learned some HTML/CSS through here,
                    it's reading-heavy but you learn a whole lot.

                    An online community of a bunch of cool people who like to code things.
                    All skill levels, and they run events where you can get cool stuff if you code stuff (You Ship We Ship [YSWS]).
                    Join the slack! Jersev's there sometimes.

                    Verifying that you're a student give you access to Github Pro, which gives you access to a bunch of Github Codespaces hours.
                    On top of this, you gain access to a bunch of <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank">services (such as Scrimba!) and courses</a> for free.
                    HIGHLY recommend signing up, the process is super simple. (but let me know if you need help it was a bit of a search...)

                    We use Github to collaborate on projects (such as <a href="https://github.com/BHS-Codes/bhs-codes.github.io" target="_blank">this website, hosted on Github!</a> [don't look at the source code it's not good])
                    We have a BHSC organization page that we will get you guys added to later in the year.
                    Don't worry too much if you have no idea what you're looking at when you open Github, we'll walk through it once we start using it.
                    (though some <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git" target="_blank">light reading</a> never hurts.)
